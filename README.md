More inside jokes over there!

### [OdysseyX](https://github.com/themrsung/OdysseyX)

## Contributing
I'll accept anything unless its mathematically correct.
Any SG jokes are welcome. Just make it not too obvious.

**Mathematically sound concepts will not be accepted!**

## Conventions
I don't really care about how you name things.
Just make sure you avoid the names of key classes from `OdysseyX`.

The two projects use the same group id, and I don't want them to get mixed up.

## License
Whatever. Do what you want with this.
